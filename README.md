- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @koleada

- I am a computer science major, early on in my journey with computers. I became interested in this space after being introduced to cryptocurrency and beginning to 
 learn about the underlying technology. Since then I have become truly intrigued with computers and this amazing community. I'm currently trying to learn as much
 as I can and get experience along the way. 

- Some of my big interests are, [cybersecuity: scripting, ethical hacking tools, Linux ...], [website development: HTML, CSS, Javascript], [Software Development with Python, JavaScript, and Java] [Cryptocurrency/Economics: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, and underlying concepts]
